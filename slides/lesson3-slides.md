# How Your 3D Printer Created Objects

## The Complete Printing Process

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Step 1: Slicing**

- Computer cuts design into thin layers
- Each layer 0.2mm thick
- Hundreds of layers per object

**Step 2: Layer by Layer**

- Hot plastic draws each layer
- One layer at a time, bottom to top
- Each layer sticks to the one below

**Step 3: Cooling & Bonding**

- Hot plastic cools down quickly
- Layers bond together as they cool
- Final object becomes one solid piece

**Safety Reminder:**

- Never touch hot parts (200°C+!)
- Don't reach into printer while working
- Tell a teacher if something looks wrong

# Today's Challenge: Design a Container

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Your Mission: Create a small container for desk supplies**

**Container Requirements:**

- Big enough for paperclips or erasers
- Has walls and a bottom
- Hollow inside (using "Hole" tool!)
- Printable size (fits on build plate)

**Design Tips:**

- Walls should be at least 2mm thick
- Bottom should be at least 1mm thick
- Opening big enough for your hand
- Test size by measuring real objects

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Think Like a Designer:**

- What problem does your container solve?
- Who would use this container?
- Where would they keep it?
- How can you make it better?

**Today's Process:**

1. Start with cube or cylinder
2. Add smaller shape inside
3. Make inner shape a "Hole"
4. Group them together

*We'll learn the "Hole" tool that makes shapes subtract instead of add!*
