# What Worked Well?

## Examining Our Prints

**Let's analyze together:**

- **What** printed successfully?
- **What** had challenges?
- **Why** did some work better than others?
- **How** can we improve?

# The Power of Iteration

## Making Things Better

**Iteration means:**

- **Looking** at what you made
- **Finding** ways to improve it
- **Making** changes
- **Testing** again

*Real designers do this all the time!*

# Common Printing Issues

## Learning from Problems

- **Walls too thin** - make them thicker (2mm+)
- **Overhangs failed** - add support or redesign
- **Parts don't fit** - check measurements
- **Rough surfaces** - simplify complex curves

---

# Today's Mission

## Improve and Perfect

**You can:**

- **Fix problems** with existing designs
- **Make** your problem-solver better
- **Start** a completely new project
- **Prepare** your best work for printing

---

# Design Improvement Focus

## Key Areas to Check

- **Wall thickness** - at least 2mm
- **Part connections** - do they fit together?
- **Size** - is it practical to use?
- **Details** - add personal touches
- **Functionality** - does it solve the problem?

---

# Improvement Time (25 minutes)

## Choose Your Path

- **Option 1:** Fix your container design
- **Option 2:** Improve your problem-solver
- **Option 3:** Start something completely new
- **Option 4:** Combine ideas from multiple projects

---
