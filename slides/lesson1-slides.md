# Welcome to 3D Printing!

## Today's Big Question

**What is 3D printing and how does it work?**


# Amazing 3D Printed Objects

## Look at These!

- Toys and games
- Tools and gadgets
- Prosthetics helping people
- Food (yes, food!)
- Car parts
- Medical devices

*Pass around demonstration objects*

# How Does 3D Printing Work?

## Think of Building with Pancakes!

- 3D printing builds objects **layer by layer**
- Like stacking pancakes on top of each other
- Each layer sticks to the one below it

---

# From Computer to Object

## The 3 Steps

1. **Design** - We create on computers
2. **Slice** - Computer breaks design into layers
3. **Print** - Machine builds layer by layer

*Show infographic: "From Computer to Object in 3 Steps"*

# The Magic Material

## How Plastic Becomes Objects

- Plastic filament gets **heated up**
- Squeezed out like **frosting from a tube**
- **Cools down** and hardens
- Layers **stick together** as they cool

---

# Real-World Examples

## 3D Printing Helps People

- **Custom phone cases** and game pieces
- **Replacement parts** for broken toys
- **Art projects** and sculptures
- **Helpful tools** for people with disabilities
- **Medical devices** like prosthetics
- **Aerospace** and car parts

---

# Interactive Activity

## Object Detective

*Examine the printed objects on your table*

- What do you think each object is used for?
- Can you see the layers?
- Which one is your favorite? Why?

---

# Safety First!

## 3D Printer Safety Rules

- **Never touch** the hot parts
- **Don't reach** into the printer while it's working
- **Tell a teacher** if something looks wrong
- The printer gets **very hot** - like an oven!

---

# Live Demonstration

## Watch the Printer Work!

*Show the actual 3D printer in action*

- **Hot end** - where plastic comes out
- **Build plate** - where object grows
- **Filament** - the plastic "thread"
