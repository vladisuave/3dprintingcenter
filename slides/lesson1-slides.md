# Welcome to 3D Printing!

## Establish Class Expectations

**What are our 3D Printing M&Ms?**

---

# Welcome to 3D Printing!

## Establish Class Expectations

- Model Respect
   - respect centermates' work
   - respect the printers
      - don't get hurt by them
      - don't hurt them
   - respect the mere 45 minutes per center lesson
- Make Good Choices
- Solve Problems
   - If you know how, help your peers

# Welcome to 3D Printing!

## Today's Big Question

**What is 3D printing and how does it work?**

---

# Amazing 3D Printed Objects

## Look at These!

- Toys and games
- Tools and gadgets
- Decorations
- Food (yes, food!)

*Pass around demonstration objects*

# How Does 3D Printing Work?

## Think of Building with Pancakes!

- 3D printing builds objects **layer by layer**
- Like stacking pancakes on top of each other
- Each layer sticks to the one below it

## The 3 Steps

1. **Design** - We create on computers
2. **Slice** - Computer breaks design into layers
3. **Print** - Machine builds layer by layer

## How Plastic Becomes Objects

- Plastic filament gets **heated up**
- Squeezed out like **frosting from a tube**
- **Cools down** and hardens
- Layers **stick together** as they cool

# Real-World Examples

## 3D Printing Helps People

- **Custom phone cases** and game pieces
- **Replacement parts** for broken toys
- **Art projects** and sculptures
- **Helpful tools**
- **Medical devices** like prosthetics
- **Aerospace** and car parts

---

# Interactive Activity

## Object Detective

*Examine the printed objects on your table*

- What do you think each object is used for?
- Can you see the layers?
- Which one is your favorite? Why?

---

# Safety First!

## 3D Printer Safety Rules

- **Never touch** the hot parts
- **Don't reach** into the printer while it's working
- **Tell a teacher** if something looks wrong
- The printer gets **very hot** - like an oven!

---

# Live Demonstration

## Watch the Printer Work!

*Show the actual 3D printer in action*

- **Hot end** - where plastic comes out
- **Build plate** - where object grows
- **Filament** - the plastic "thread"

---

# What We Learned Today

## 3D Printing is Amazing!

- Builds objects **layer by layer**
- Starts with **computer designs**
- Uses **heated plastic**
- Helps people in **many ways**
- Is used in **many industries**

---

# Coming Up Next

## Lesson 2 Preview

**"Now that we know what 3D printing is, we'll learn to design our own objects!"**

- Learn to use Tinkercad
- Design your first keychain
- See your ideas come to life!

# Reflection Time

## What surprised you most about 3D printing?

*Quick sharing - one word or phrase*

---

# Cleanup Time!

## 5 Minutes to Pack Up

- Help organize demonstration materials
- Put objects back carefully
- Clean up your workspace
- Get ready for next class

**Great job learning about 3D printing today!**
