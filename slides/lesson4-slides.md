# The Design Process

## How Real Designers Work

1. **Think** - What problem will you solve? (5 min)
2. **Sketch** - Draw your idea on paper (5 min)
3. **Build** - Create in Tinkercad (20 min)

*Follow this process like a real designer!*

---

# Step 1: Think (5 minutes)

## Problem Identification

**Ask yourself:**
- What **frustrates** me at school or home?
- What **falls over** or gets lost?
- What would make my life **easier**?
- What would help my **family** or **friends**?

*Write down your problem on paper*

---

# Step 2: Sketch (5 minutes)

## Draw Your Solution

**On paper, sketch:**
- **What** your solution looks like
- **How** it solves the problem
- **Where** the important parts are
- **How big** it should be

*Don't worry about perfect drawing!*

---

# Step 3: Build (20 minutes)

## Bring Your Idea to Life

**In Tinkercad:**
- **Start simple** - basic shapes first
- **Add details** as you go
- **Test** if it makes sense
- **Adjust** if needed

---

# Design Guidelines

## Keep It Printable

- **Size** - fits on printer bed
- **Walls** - at least 2mm thick
- **Overhangs** - avoid if possible
- **Holes** - at least 3mm diameter

---

# Teacher Support Available

## Get Help When Needed

- **Stuck on a problem?** Ask for brainstorming help
- **Tinkercad trouble?** Raise your hand
- **Not sure if it will print?** Check with teacher
- **Want to try something new?** Go for it!

---

# Problem-Solving Tips

## Think Like an Engineer

- **Start simple** - you can always add more
- **Think about the user** - who will use this?
- **Consider materials** - will plastic work?
- **Test your logic** - does the solution make sense?

---

# Real-World Inspiration

## How 3D Printing Helps

- **Prosthetics** help people walk and grab things
- **Tools** make work easier
- **Organizers** keep things tidy
- **Replacement parts** fix broken items
- **Custom solutions** for unique problems

---

# Halfway Check-In

## How's It Going?

*After 15 minutes of building*

- **Share** your problem with a neighbor
- **Show** your progress
- **Get** a fresh perspective
- **Help** each other if stuck

---

# Advanced Challenges

## For Fast Finishers

- **Add moving parts** (if you know how)
- **Create multiple versions** of your solution
- **Think about manufacturing** - could this be mass-produced?
- **Design for different users** - kids vs adults

---

# Testing Your Design

## Does It Solve the Problem?

**Ask yourself:**
- **Would this actually work?**
- **Is it the right size?**
- **Would people want to use it?**
- **What could make it better?**

---

# Save and Document

## Preserve Your Work

1. **Save** your Tinkercad design
2. **Write down** your problem statement
3. **Note** how your design solves it
4. **Think** about what you'd change

---

# Sharing Circle

## Present Your Solution

**Quick 30-second shares:**
- **"My problem is..."**
- **"My solution is..."**
- **"It works because..."**

*No formal presentations - just quick sharing!*

---
