# 6-Lesson Upper Grade Center Curriculum (Grades 3-5)

## Course Overview

Students will learn basic 3D design and printing through hands-on projects using Tinkercad. This 6-lesson rotation (45 minutes each) begins with understanding what 3D printing is, then progresses to hands-on design and creation of simple, functional objects.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

- Understand what 3D printing is and how it works
- Navigate Tinkercad to create basic 3D designs
- Design objects considering size and printing limitations
- Create at least two original 3D designs
- Identify real-world applications of 3D printing

## Materials Needed

- 3D printer (any modern FDM printer)
- PLA filament
- Chromebooks with internet access
- Sample printed objects for demonstration
- Cross-section examples of printed objects

# Lesson 1: What is 3D Printing? (45 minutes)

## Establish class expectations (5 minutes)

For example but not limited to:

- Model Respect
   - respect centermates' work
   - respect the printers
      - don't get hurt by them
      - don't hurt them
   - respect the mere 45 minutes per center lesson
- Make Good Choices
- Solve Problems
   - If you know how, help your peers

## Introduction and Hook (5 minutes)

**Hook:** Show students amazing 3D printed objects - toys, tools, food!

**Key Question:** "What is 3D printing and how does it work?"

## Core Concepts with Visual Demonstrations (10 minutes)

**How 3D Printing Works:**

- 3D printing builds objects layer by layer, like stacking pancakes
- We design on computers, then the printer makes it real
- Plastic gets heated and squeezed out like frosting from a tube
- Show infographic from Placerville EDC Library

**Visual Demonstrations:**

- Use simple infographics showing the layer-by-layer process
- Pass around printed objects at different stages (if available)
- Show cross-section of a printed object to reveal layers

## Real-World Examples and Applications (10 minutes)

**Examples for Kids:**

- Custom phone cases and game pieces
- Replacement parts for broken toys
- Art projects and sculptures
- Helpful tools
- Aerospace and car parts
- Food printing (chocolate!)

**Interactive Activity:** Students examine printed objects and guess what they're used for

## 3D Printer Live Demonstration (10 minutes)

- Show the actual 3D printer (if available)
- Explain the basic parts: hot end, build plate, filament
- Safety rules: Never touch hot parts, don't reach in while printing (pinch hazards)

## Cleanup and Preview (5 minutes)

- Students help organize demonstration materials
- Preview next lesson: "Now that we know what 3D printing is, we'll learn to design our own objects!"
- Quick reflection: "What was the most surprising thing you learned about 3D printing?"

1. Start with a basic shape (cube, cylinder, etc.)
2. Add text with their name or initials
3. Create a hole for the keyring
4. Combine shapes together

**Teacher Support:**

\newpage

# Lesson 3: How Printing Works + Design a Container (45 minutes)

## Printing Process Deep Dive (10 minutes)

- Review keychains that have been printed from last lesson
- Explain the printing process in detail (in a show and tell way with Polar3D/Bambu Studio):
  - Computer slices design into thin layers (show slicing software if possible)
  - Printer draws each layer with melted plastic
  - Layers stick together as they cool
- Show printer in action if available

**Safety Rules Review:**

- Never touch the hot parts
- Don't reach into the printer while it's working
- Tell a teacher if something looks wrong

## New Project: Simple Container (25 minutes)

**Design Challenge:** Create a small container for desk supplies

**Requirements:**

- Big enough to hold paperclips or erasers
- Has walls and a bottom
- Learn to use the "Hole" tool to hollow out the inside

**Step-by-Step Guidance:**

1. Start with a cube or cylinder
2. Add a smaller shape inside
3. Make the inner shape a "Hole"
4. Group them together

## Troubleshooting and Cleanup (10 minutes)

- Help students who are struggling
- Save work and clean up workstations

\newpage

# Lesson 4: Problem-Solving Design Challenge (45 minutes)

# Teacher Preparation Notes

## Before Each Lesson:

- **Lesson 1:** Prepare infographics, demonstration objects, and cross-sections
- **Lessons 2-6:** Test all computers/tablets for Tinkercad access
- Have backup activities for students who finish early
- Queue up printing jobs from previous lessons
- Prepare printed examples to show
- **Important:** Plan for 5-minute cleanup time at end of each lesson

## Printing Management:

- Print student work between lessons when possible
- Keep designs simple to ensure printing success
- Have a few backup printed items in case of printer failures
- Consider printing 2-3 designs per session to manage time

## Common Challenges:

- **Students going too fast:** Encourage them to add details or help peers
- **Students struggling:** Pair with successful peers or provide extra guidance
- **Technical issues:** Have simple backup activities ready
- **Mixed grade levels:** Use peer mentoring and differentiated expectations
- **Time management:** Shorter lessons require tighter pacing and clear transitions

## Lesson 1 Specific Preparation:

- Gather diverse 3D printed objects from different industries
- Prepare cross-section examples (cut printed objects in half if possible)
- Have printer ready for live demonstration
- Plan interactive activities for examining objects

## Extension Ideas:

- Create a classroom gallery of printed objects
- Connect to other subjects (math shapes, science tools, art projects)
- Invite parents to see student work
- Consider a school-wide 3D printing showcase
- Document the "what is 3D printing" lesson with photos for future reference
