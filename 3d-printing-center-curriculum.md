- Understand what 3D printing is and how it works
- Navigate Tinkercad to create basic 3D designs
- Explain the layer-by-layer printing process
- Design objects considering size and printing limitations
- Create at least two original 3D designs
- Identify real-world applications of 3D printing

### Materials Needed

- 3D printer (any modern FDM printer)
- Computers/tablets with internet access
- PLA filament
- Sample printed objects for demonstration
- Simple infographics showing 3D printing process
- Cross-section examples of printed objects
- Variety of 3D printed objects from different industries

**Key Question:** "What is 3D printing and how does it work?"

### Core Concepts with Visual Demonstrations (15 minutes)

**How 3D Printing Works:**
- 3D printing builds objects layer by layer, like stacking pancakes
- We design on computers, then the printer makes it real
- Plastic gets heated and squeezed out like frosting from a tube

## Teacher Preparation Notes

### Before Each Lesson:

- **Lesson 1:** Prepare infographics, demonstration objects, and cross-sections
- **Lessons 2-6:** Test all computers/tablets for Tinkercad access
- Have backup activities for students who finish early
- Queue up printing jobs from previous lessons
- Prepare printed examples to show
- **Important:** Plan for 5-minute cleanup time at end of each lesson

### Printing Management:

- Print student work between lessons when possible
- Keep designs simple to ensure printing success
- Have a few backup printed items in case of printer failures
- Consider printing 2-3 designs per session to manage time
- **New timing:** With 45-minute lessons, printing schedule is more critical

### Common Challenges:

- **Students going too fast:** Encourage them to add details or help peers
- **Students struggling:** Pair with successful peers or provide extra guidance
- **Technical issues:** Have simple backup activities ready
- **Mixed grade levels:** Use peer mentoring and differentiated expectations
- **Time management:** Shorter lessons require tighter pacing and clear transitions

### Lesson 1 Specific Preparation:

- Gather diverse 3D printed objects from different industries
- Create or find simple infographics showing layer-by-layer process
- Prepare cross-section examples (cut printed objects in half if possible)
- Have printer ready for live demonstration
- Plan interactive activities for examining objects

### Extension Ideas:

- Create a classroom gallery of printed objects
- Connect to other subjects (math shapes, science tools, art projects)
- Invite parents to see student work
- Consider a school-wide 3D printing showcase
- Document the "what is 3D printing" lesson with photos for future reference
